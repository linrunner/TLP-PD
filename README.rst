TLP Profiles Daemon (TLP-PD)
----------------------------
This daemon implements the D-Bus interface org.freedesktop.UPower.PowerProfile
which is displayed in desktop environments as a power profile switch.
Together with TLP as the backend for applying these profiles,
it replaces the power-profiles-daemon.

Note: it is planned to transfer TLP-PD to the
`TLP repository <https://github.com/linrunner/TLP>`_.
